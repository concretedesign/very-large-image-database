# Very Large Image Database

This meteor project is designed to watch e.g. a networked folder of images and display them in an easily scannable & filterable interface.

### Setup:
- Update `server.js` with a path to the directory you want to watch (FIXME: this should be in a setting file)
- Symlink that directory into your `/public` directory as `/public/pics`
- run `meteor`
